## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars1, include=FALSE}
## this Chunk is for reading files
library(readr)
sparrows <- read_csv("/Users/jiayuegao/Desktop/Multivariate Analysis/Week 3 Sample Code/Bumpus_sparrows.csv")
```


```{r cars}
# file reading is in the above chunk
#str(sparrows)
#boxplot(sparrows[,2:6])
#stars(sparrows,labels = sparrows$Survivorship)

attach(sparrows)

# Create scatterplot matrix 
# diagonal label
labs.diagonal <- c("Total length","Alar extent","L. beak & head","L. humerous","L. keel & sternum")

# Scatter Plot Matrix
#install.packages("car")
library(car)
scatterplotMatrix(~Total_length+Alar_extent+L_beak_head+L_humerous+L_keel_sternum | Survivorship, data=sparrows, var.labels=labs.diagonal,cex.labels=0.7, diagonal="boxplot",smooth=FALSE,reg.line=FALSE,pch=c(1,16),col=rep("black",2), legend.plot=FALSE)

# The diagonal value of the scatterplot matrix reveals that the distribution of several attributes is different for survived and non-survived sparrows. The differences in graph shapes are particularly noticeable for total length and L_humerous, indicating that these two attributes may be helpful when determining the sparrow's survival rate.

# Also, pair-wise scatterplots reveal some information. The trendlines of survived and non-survived sparrows have different slopes for certain pairs of attributes. For example, the trend lines of survived and non-survived sparrows in the Alar-extent and L_Keel & Sternum graphs differ. This is also true for the Total_length and L_humerous and several other graphs, suggesting that the correlation between these attributes among survived and non-survived groups are different.







library(ggplot2)


# create GGPLOT to visualize correlation between attributes for survived and non-survived sparrows
# the scatterplot matrix shows that trendlines for L_humerous&Total_length and Alar_extent&L_keel_sternum differ.
# Use ggplot to further examine these two pairs
ggplot(sparrows, aes(x=L_humerous, y=Total_length, color=Survivorship)) + geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm")
# regression lines for both S and NS are positive have slightly different slopes



ggplot(sparrows, aes(x=Alar_extent, y=L_keel_sternum, color=Survivorship)) + geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm")
# regression lines for both S and NS are positive but have different slopes, indicating a difference in relationship between Alar_extent and L_keel_sternum for Survived and non-survived sparrows





# create density plot and ggridges to understand distribution of attributes. Works better than histogram as it shows a smooth curve
ggplot(sparrows, aes(x=Total_length)) + geom_density() 
# graph for total length is right skewed


ggplot(sparrows, aes(x=Alar_extent)) + geom_density() 
# graph for Alar_extent has two peaks, indicating density around two separate value ranges


ggplot(sparrows, aes(x=L_humerous)) + geom_density() 
# graph for L_humerous is balanced



# create box plot to understand the distribution and quartile information
ggplot(sparrows, aes(x=Total_length, y=Survivorship)) + geom_boxplot()
# compared to survived, median of Total_length for non-survived sparrows is greater 
# compared to survived, upper quartile Q3 of Total_length for non-survived sparrows is greater.



ggplot(sparrows, aes(x=Alar_extent, y=Survivorship)) + geom_boxplot()
# compared to survived, median of Alar_extent for non-survived sparrows is greater 
# compared to survived, upper quartile Q3 of Alar_extent for non-survived sparrows is similar.



ggplot(sparrows, aes(x=L_humerous, y=Survivorship)) + geom_boxplot()
# compared to survived, median of L_humerous for non-survived sparrows is similar. 
# compared to survived, upper quartile Q3 of L_humerous for non-survived sparrows is greater.
# compared to survived, lower quartile Q1 of L_humerous for non-survived sparrows is smaller.
